What is holidata?
=================

Holidata is a utility for algorithmically producing holidays for a given locale
and year. This requires date calculations and a syntax for defining the formula
for a holiday.

Formula
-------

What is needed to calculate holidays?  Here are the necessary elements:

  - Determination of Easter Sunday
  - Add/subtract a fixed number of days to a date
  - Project forwards to the next Monday
  - Project backwards to the previous Friday
  - Determine 'first/last/Nth X in Y' dates
  - Some metadata regarding the type of holiday

Given the above, a formula can be written to define each holiday.

Notes from Dirk:

Nearly all holiday dates in Germany fall into one of two categories, fixed or depending on easter. That makes them easy to describe. It will be much more difficult in other countries like Great Britain where holidays are shifted (postponed?) to the next weekday if they occur on weekends.

So, I can think of a this:

postpone = yes # Great Britain

Depending on easter:
easter -52 days: Old Maids' Day
easter -48 days: Carnival Monday
easter -46 days: Ash Wednesday
easter  -2 days: Good Friday
easter     days: Easter Sunday
easter  +1 days: Easter Monday
easter +39 days: Ascension Day (Father's Day)
easter +49 days: Whit Sunday
easter +50 days: Whit Monday
easter +60 days: Feast of Corpus Christi

June - 1 Friday: Last Friday in June
July + 2 Monday: Second Monday in July

If you put that in brackets, you could do maths.

There is a funfair in my hometown which starts on the day before the 1st Saturday of August.

(August + 1 Saturday) - 1 day: Cranger Kirmes Start

What is holidata?
=================

Holidata is a utility for algorithmically producing holidays for a given locale
and year. This requires date calculations and a syntax for defining the formula
for a holiday.

-------

What is needed to calculate holidays?  Here are the necessary elements:

  - Determination of Easter Sunday
  - Add/subtract a fixed number of days to a date
  - Project forwards to the next Monday
  - Project backwards to the previous Friday
  - Determine 'first/last/Nth X in Y' dates

Given the above, a formula can be written to define each holiday.
